        <h1>Second Brain - Book Notes</h1>
        <p>The concept of the “Second Brain,” popularized by Tiago Forte in his book <em>Building a Second Brain</em>, is all about organizing and managing information efficiently. This system is particularly useful for technical documentation, as it allows you to structure and retrieve complex information easily. Here’s a refresher on the key concepts, with examples tailored to technical documentation.</p>

        <h2>Core Principles of the Second Brain</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Capture</strong>: Collect information that you encounter—whether it’s ideas, project requirements, or reference material—into a central repository.</li>
            <li><strong>Organize</strong>: Use a system to categorize and store this information so it’s easy to find and use later. Tiago Forte suggests using the <strong>PARA method</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Projects</strong>: Current work, what's on the stove. Example: refactor code to use the v2 of the third-party API.</li>
                    <li><strong>Areas</strong>: Broader in scope than projects. What's in the fridge. Example: the documentation of the third-party API with previous migrations, post mortems, etc. Or similarly, the app feature that uses this third-party API.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resources</strong>: General reference materials, such as coding standards, best practices, or frameworks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Archive</strong>: Completed projects and information that’s no longer actively used.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Distill</strong>: Break down your notes into the most important and actionable items. Summarize, highlight key points, and simplify complex information.</li>
            <li><strong>Express</strong>: Use your organized notes to create and share new work, whether it’s updating documentation, writing a new user manual, or coding.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Tags, Links, Metadata, and Folders</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tags</strong> - organize resources</li>
            <li><strong>Links</strong> - connect resources to projects or themselves</li>
            <li><strong>Metadata</strong> - add more description - used for views, dashboards, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Folders</strong> - namespace (for projects and resources)</li>
        </ul>
